# OpenStack IID Attestor

## Overview

The OpenStack InstanceID(IID) attestor is a plugin for the SPIRE Agent and SPIRE Server that allows SPIRE to automatically attest instances using the OpenStack Instance Metadata API. Agents attested by the `openstack_iid` attestor will be issued a SPIFFE ID like `spiffe://TRUST_DOMAIN/spire/agent/openstack_iid/PROJECT_ID/INSTANCE_ID`. This plugin requires a allow-list of ProjectID from which nodes can be attested. This also means that you shouldn't run multiple trust domains from the same OpenStack Project(**TBD**).

## Base SVID SPIFFE ID Format

```
spiffe://TRUST_DOMAIN/agent/openstack_iid/PROJECT_ID/INSTANCE_ID
```

## Pre-Requisites

This plugin requires a running SPIRE server and agent each on the OpenStack Nova Instances.

## Configuring the server plugin

https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/master/conf/server/server.conf

The server plugin configuration template is as below:

```hcl
plugins {
    NodeAttestor "openstack_iid" {
        plugin_cmd = "/path/to/plugin_cmd"
        plugin_checksum = "(SHOULD) sha256 of the plugin binary"
        plugin_data {
            cloud_name = "test"
            projectid_allow_list = ["123", "abc"]
        }
    }
...
```

| key | type | required | description | example |
|:----|:-----|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| cloud_name | string | ✓ | Name of cloud entry in clouds.yaml to use |  |
| projectid_allow_list | array | ✓ | List of authorized ProjectIDs | |

The plugin_name should be "openstack_iid" and matches the name used in plugin config. The plugin_cmd should specify the path to the plugin binary.

### Setup openstack configuration file (clouds.yaml) on instances

see: https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/configuration/index.html

## Configuring agent plugin

https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/master/conf/agent/agent.conf

The agent plugin configuration template is as below:

```hcl
plugins {
    NodeAttestor "openstack_iid" {
        plugin_cmd = "/path/to/plugin_cmd"
        plugin_checksum = "(SHOULD) sha256 of the plugin binary"
        plugin_data {
        }
    }
...
```

The plugin_name should be "openstack_iid" and matches the name used in plugin config. The plugin_cmd should specify the path to the agent binary.

## Security Consideration

At this time OpenStack doesn't have signature for Identity information like AWS Instance Identity Documents or GCP Instance Identity Token. Therefore, Server can't prevent spoofing by a malicious Agent.
As a mitigation measure, re-attestation of the same instance is prohibited.
In the future, if it is possible to acquire more information that can attest the agent from OpenStack or Plugin feature, it is possible to more strictly identify the agent.
For instance, in the Server Plugin, it is conceivable to compare the IP address of the request source with the IP address associated with the instance obtainable from the instance metadata.

### Request for Comment
We propose the [OpenStack IID](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HkK3Q74yYiqckBMI-h9FrZdlWEkrY5R4uHbXRqSRlW8) to mitigate the risk.  
[Here](https://github.com/zlabjp/spire-openstack-plugin/tree/poc-dynamic-json) are the PoC files.

## Re-Attestation the instance
If you need to re-attestation the instance which is attested before, you need to evict the entry.

```
$ spire-server agent evict -spiffeID ${Agent's SPIFFE ID}
```
